<h1>
Copper </h1>

<h3>Copper is going to face a multi-year bullish market trend</h3>

<h3>
<p class="underline">Drivers:</p>
</h3>

1. The green energy commitments will be  powered through electricity and copper is really important because it is one of the most economical conductors of electricity.  
2. The production i.e. copper mining is lower now than it was in the past.
3. It will take time to license new mining projects.
4. Current mining projects are of poor quality.
5. All these reasons will cause the demand for copper to exceed supply and that would hike the prices.

<h3>
	Technical Analysis
</h3>

- In the year 2020, there was a bullish reversal after a multi year bearish/sideways trend
-  Copper has been moving in a bullish channel making constant higher highs and higher lows. 
-  When analysing how long this trend will last, it is important to consider elliot wave theory. Note, that elliot theory won't gurantee that the trend will change because it greatly depends on the accuracy of wave counts. 
-  Considering that the channel constitutes the first mega wave of a 12345 wave pattern, then the lower level waves have been sketched inside the channel. 
-  It is likely that there maybe a 5th wave (which means we have a false breakdown on a day chart). I think so because the price has taken support at the lower trendline of the channel. 
-  The other possibility is that we may have a correction. However, in a longer time frame, this would just give us the 2nd wave of a mega 12345 wave and lead to the rapid growth of a 3rd wave.
